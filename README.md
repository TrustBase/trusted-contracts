## Prepare environment

For building the example smart contracts found in this folder you will need to have [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract) installed.

```
cargo install cargo-contract --force
```

We use the `--force` to update to the most recent `cargo-contract` version.

## Build contract

Navigate to the root of the smart contract and run the following command:

`cargo contract build`
